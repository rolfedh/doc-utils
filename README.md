# doc-utils

This repository contains standalone scripts designed to help technical writers with documentation tasks.

**Purpose:**
Each script in this repository is self-contained and documents its own purpose, usage instructions, and examples at the top of the script file. For details on how to use a script, open the script and read the initial docstring or comments.

## Current Scripts

- **scannable.py**  
  Checks the scannability of AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) files in the current directory. It reports sentences that are too long and paragraphs that contain too many sentences, based on configurable limits. Usage instructions and examples are provided at the top of the script.

## How to Use

1. Open the script you are interested in (for example, `scannable.py`).
2. Read the top of the script for instructions, options, and examples.
3. Run the script from your terminal as described in the usage section.
